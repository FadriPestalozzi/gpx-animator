GPX Animator
============

Introduction
------------

GPX Animator generates a top-down view map video from one or more GPX files generated by most standard GPS tracking devices.

GPX Animator has a graphical user interface that works on most operating systems, but works with a pure command-line interface as well.

More information and downloadable executables can be found at https://gpx-animator.app.

Basic usage
-----------

```
# help
java -jar gpx-animator-x.y.z.jar --help

# create movie with default settings
java -jar gpx-animator-x.y.z.jar --input track.gpx
```
(where *x.y.z* refers to the version of the jar you built or downloaded)

Advanced command line example
-----------

This example takes GPX file `input.gpx` as input, uses Google Maps as background map, makes the background non-transparent, makes the map movable by placing a 640x640 viewport over the map, forces the video to be 120000ms (2 minutes) long, makes the dot trail 10000ms (10 seconds) long, pre-draws the full track in grey (RGB color code #808080), hides the attribution overlay, and places the default information (lat/lng, speed, time) overlay at the bottom left. Output is stored in `movie.mp4`.

```
java -jar ./build/libs/gpx-animator-1.6.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
	  --input input.gpx
	  --tms-url-template 'http://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=m&x={x}&y={y}&z={zoom}'
	  --background-map-visibility 1.0
	  --viewport-height 640 --viewport-width 640
	  --total-time 120000
	  --tail-duration 10000
	  --predraw-track --predraw-track-color '#808080'
	  --attribution ''
	  --information-location 'bottom left'
	  --output movie.mp4
```

Build
-----------

GPX Animator uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system to build a JAR file. You do not need Gradle installed on your system. This project uses the Gradle Wrapper.

```
./gradlew assemble
# successful build puts .jar file in build/libs/
```

After a successful build, the JAR file can be found in the `build/libs/` directory.

Tests can be temporarily skipped by running

```
./gradlew assemble -x test
```

Run
-----------

To run GPX Animator from source:

```
./gradlew run
```

If necessary, the project will be (re)compiled.

Test
-----------

To run tests in `src/test/`:

```
./gradlew test
```
